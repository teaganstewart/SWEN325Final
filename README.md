This is Teagan Stewart's solo implementation of my Assignment Two SWEN325 App in React Native. Originally was in a group, but we decided to work solo.

Download my project
Place it into a minimal ionic react project
Navigate to the project location in command line
Run The following commands:     <br/>  
$ npm install firebase <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation-stack <br/>
$ npm install @react-native-community/masked-view <br/>
$ npm install react-native-calendars <br/>
$ npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs <br/>
$ npm install modal-react-native-web <br/>
$ npm install react-native-paper <br/>
$ npm install @material-ui/core <br/>
$ npm install @material-ui/pickers <br/>
$ npm install react-native-gesture-handler <br/>
$ npm install react-native-simple-time-picker <br/>
$ npm install react-navigation-tabs <br/>
$ npm install react-native-reanimated </br>
$ npm install react-native-screens <br/>
$ npm install @react-native-mapbox-gl/maps 
$ npm install react-map-gl <br/>
$ npm install react-native-popover <br/>
<br/>
The app should be running.
